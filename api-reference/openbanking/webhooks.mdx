## Understanding Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events that happen in your Paysecure account. Instead of polling the API for updates, webhooks push notifications to your application as soon as events occur.

For OpenBanking payments, webhooks are particularly important because they allow you to know immediately when a payment has been completed or failed, enabling you to take appropriate actions in your application.

## Configuring Webhooks

You can configure webhook URLs when creating a purchase by setting the following parameters:

- `success_callback`: URL to receive notifications about successful payments
- `failure_callback`: URL to receive notifications about failed payments

```javascript
{
  // ... other purchase parameters
  "success_callback": "https://your-api.com/webhooks/success",
  "failure_callback": "https://your-api.com/webhooks/failure"
}
```

## Webhook Events

Paysecure sends webhook notifications for the following OpenBanking payment events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `payment.success` | The payment has been successfully completed |
| `payment.failure` | The payment has failed |
| `payment.pending` | The payment is being processed |

## Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, Paysecure sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with a JSON payload containing details about the event.

### Success Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "purchaseId": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "merchantRef": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 49.99,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "timestamp": 1621234600,
  "payment": {
    "is_outgoing": false,
    "payment_type": "PURCHASE",
    "amount": 49.99,
    "currency": "GBP",
    "net_amount": 49.99,
    "fee_amount": 0.0,
    "description": "",
    "paid_on": 1621234600,
    "remote_paid_on": 1621234600
  }
}
```

### Failure Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "event": "payment.failure",
  "purchaseId": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "merchantRef": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "status": "failed",
  "amount": 49.99,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "timestamp": 1621234600,
  "error": {
    "code": "payment_rejected",
    "message": "Payment was rejected by the bank"
  }
}
```

## Webhook Security

To ensure that webhook notifications are coming from Paysecure, you should verify the signature included in the webhook headers.

### Verifying Webhook Signatures

Paysecure includes a `X-Paysecure-Signature` header in webhook requests. This header contains a signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of the webhook.

```javascript JavaScript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Your webhook handler
app.post('/webhooks/success', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-paysecure-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const webhookSecret = 'your-webhook-secret';
  
  // Calculate expected signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', webhookSecret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  // Verify signature
  if (signature === expectedSignature) {
    // Signature is valid, process the webhook
    const event = req.body.event;
    const purchaseId = req.body.purchaseId;
    
    // Handle the event
    if (event === 'payment.success') {
      // Update order status, send confirmation email, etc.
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
  } else {
    // Signature is invalid
    res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Respond Quickly**: Your webhook endpoint should respond with a 2xx status code as quickly as possible to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

2. **Process Asynchronously**: Process webhook events asynchronously to avoid blocking the response.

3. **Handle Retries**: Paysecure may retry webhook deliveries if your endpoint fails to respond with a 2xx status code. Make sure your webhook handler is idempotent to avoid processing the same event multiple times.

4. **Verify Signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures to ensure that webhook notifications are coming from Paysecure.

5. **Implement Logging**: Log webhook events for debugging and auditing purposes.

6. **Set Up Monitoring**: Monitor your webhook endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly.

7. **Implement Fallbacks**: Implement fallback mechanisms, such as periodic polling, in case webhook deliveries fail.
