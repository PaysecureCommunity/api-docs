## Checking Transaction Status

After initiating an OpenBanking payment, you can check its status using the `GET /purchases/{purchaseId}` endpoint. This allows you to track the progress of the payment and take appropriate actions based on the status.

### Status Flow

OpenBanking payments typically follow this status flow:

1. **created** - The purchase has been created but not yet initiated
2. **pending_execute** - The purchase is waiting for the customer to be redirected to the bank
3. **payment_in_process** - The customer has been redirected to the bank and the payment is being processed
4. **completed** - The payment has been successfully completed
5. **failed** - The payment has failed

<Warning>
It's important to implement proper status checking in your application to ensure a smooth user experience. You should also configure webhooks to receive real-time updates about payment status changes.

## Query Example

```javascript JavaScript
const axios = require("axios");

(async () => {
  const purchaseId = "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1";
  
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/purchases/${purchaseId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        "X-API-Key": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  );
  
  console.log(response.data);
})();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Implement Polling**: For time-sensitive applications, implement a polling mechanism to periodically check the status of a payment.

2. **Use Webhooks**: Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications about payment status changes.

3. **Handle Timeouts**: Implement proper timeout handling in case a payment takes longer than expected.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage cases where payments fail or encounter issues.

5. **User Communication**: Keep your users informed about the status of their payments to provide a better user experience.
