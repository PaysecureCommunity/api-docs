## Understanding OpenBanking Payments

Paysecure leverages its OpenBanking network across Europe and the UK to enable secure and fast payments, making it a top choice for customers in these regions. It allows customers to pay in EUR or GBP via the Paysecure Gateway, directly through their bank account.

### Paysecure Gateway

Paysecure Gateway is a web page that handles all user interactions during the payment initiation process, including:

- User credentials input
- Interactive confirmation
- Progress reporting
- Error reporting

After your application receives a URL for executing a payment using Paysecure, you can redirect your end-user to it. There, they will see a screen that lets them pick a provider to execute the payment. The user will be asked to input credentials and, if needed, any interactive credentials. After the process is complete, the user will be redirected back to your application URL.
## API Reference

<Warning>Authentication requires an API key in the `X-API-Key` header.</Warning>

### Get Purchase Details

This endpoint retrieves the details of a specific OpenBanking purchase.

```javascript JavaScript
const axios = require("axios");

(async () => {
  const purchaseId = "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1";
  
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/purchases/${purchaseId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        "X-API-Key": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  );
  
  console.log(response.data);
})();
```

## Webhooks

Paysecure uses webhooks to notify your application about events that happen in your account. You can configure webhook URLs when creating a purchase by setting the `success_callback` and `failure_callback` parameters.

### Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "purchaseId": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "merchantRef": "60a1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 49.99,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "timestamp": 1621234600
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response containing error details.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "message": "Missing required field: client.email"
}
```
