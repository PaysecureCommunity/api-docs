## PayIn Flows

### How it works
To initiate a PIX payment, a payer can scan the code using their PIX payment app (such as Itau, NuBank, etc.). These codes comply with BCB’s infrastructure requirements to ensure that the merchant's details are stored securely and there are no errors during the payment journey.

### Key Steps

#### Flow
1. Merchant platforms can create a dynamic QR code by passing the relevant parameter using Paysecure’s API.
2. The platform can display the dynamic QR code on its app or any website at checkout or on a third-party app.
3. The payer scans the QR code from the PIX app of their choice on their mobile.
4. The payer authorizes the transaction on the app by entering a valid PIN.
5. Once the payment is done, the merchant platform receives a transaction status callback from Paysecure to a pre-configured endpoint.
6. The platform can also check the request status using the reference ID generated from the collection request using the Check Payment Status API.
