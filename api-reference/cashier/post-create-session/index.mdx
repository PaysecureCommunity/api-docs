### Session API

#### Overview
The **createSession API** is designed to initiate a payment session for a customer after their profile has been created via the createCustomer API. The session is automatically generated at the backend on the merchant's checkout URL. This session allows the customer to continue with their transaction without having to manually interact with the session URL, and ensures the session remains active until the payment is completed or the session expires.

This API improves the user experience by reducing transaction failures and enhancing the overall payment process, thus reducing transaction churn rates.

#### Key Features
- **Seamless Checkout**: The session URL is automatically generated and active at the backend, ensuring a smoother and uninterrupted customer experience.
- **Reduced Transaction Failures**: By ensuring the session remains active during the payment process, the chances of transaction failures due to session timeouts are minimized.
- **Improved User Experience**: The customer does not need to click on a session URL or navigate away from the page, leading to faster and more secure payment processing.

#### Endpoint
**POST**: Create Session

## Usage Flow

1. **Customer completes the createCustomer API**: Once the customer is created via the createCustomer API, the merchant proceeds to call the createSession API to generate a session.

2. **Merchant sends createSession request**: The merchant sends a POST request to the createSession API with the customer's customerId and the merchant's brandId.

3. **Session created automatically on the checkout URL**: PaySecure creates the session and associates it with the merchant's checkout page. This session remains active on the backend, allowing the customer to continue the payment process without interruption.

4. **Customer proceeds to checkout**: The customer is redirected to the checkout page as part of the merchant's payment flow, where the session is automatically validated. The session remains active for a set period, allowing the customer to complete the payment without needing to manually interact with the session URL.

5. **Session Expiry**: The session expires after the set expiration time (expiryOn), ensuring the payment process is completed within the defined window.

## Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce Checkout
Integrate the API into your e-commerce platform to create seamless payment sessions for customers who have already created profiles.

### 2. Subscription Services
Use the API to set up payment sessions for subscription renewals without requiring customers to re-enter their information.

### 3. Multi-product Purchases
Process payments for multiple products in a single transaction with detailed product information.

### 4. Streamlined Payment Flows
Create tailored payment experiences by configuring specific callback URLs and redirects.

## Integration Tips

1. **Customer Profile First**: Always ensure the customer profile is created via the createCustomer API before calling the createSession API.
2. **Secure Authentication**: Use secure Bearer Token authentication and include the BrandId in the header for all API calls.
3. **Webhook Implementation**: Set up robust webhook handlers for success and failure callbacks to ensure reliable transaction tracking.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage various session scenarios, especially for customer not found errors.
5. **Session Management**: Be aware of session expiration times and design your user flow accordingly.
