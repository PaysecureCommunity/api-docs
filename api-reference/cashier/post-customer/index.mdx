### Customer Profile API

#### Overview
The **createCustomer API**  allows merchants to create a customer profile on Paysecure when a user visits their website, facilitating a seamless payment experience by pre-filling the customer's details on the Paysecure Cashier. The API takes in customer information and returns a unique customerID that can be passed in purchase payload, eliminating the need for customers to manually enter their details during transactions.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. At Checkout
When a customer initiates the checkout process, your system should invoke the createCustomer API before starting the payment session.

1. **Call createCustomer**: This API call generates a unique customer ID.
2. **Use of Customer ID**: Pass the returned customer ID in Session API when creating a payment session.

### 2. Upon Customer Login
Alternatively, merchants may choose to call createCustomer at the time of customer login on their site.

1. **Persistent Customer Profiles**: This approach helps build or maintain a persistent customer profile, ensuring the customer ID is available for any subsequent payment sessions without needing to call createCustomer again.
2. **Integration Flexibility**: This is useful for merchants who want to initialize customer data early in the customer journey rather than during checkout.

**Note**: The second method is not advised for white-label merchants who want to manage different customerIDs for each brand.

## User Flow

1. **Customer visits merchant's website**: The customer selects the product or service and proceeds to checkout page.
2. **Merchant calls the createCustomer API**: The merchant sends a POST request to the Paysecure API with the customer's details.
3. **Customer ID generation**: Paysecure processes the request and generates a unique customerId which is returned in the response.
4. **Payment Process**: The merchant uses the customerId for subsequent transactions, ensuring the customer doesn't need to re-enter their details for future payments.

## Benefits

- **Seamless user experience**: The customer does not have to enter their details manually for every purchase.
- **Faster Checkout**: The merchant can use the customerId for faster payment processing.
- **Data Security**: Customer details are stored securely and can be reused across transactions, reducing the chances of errors.

## Error Response
If there are any errors, they will be in the following format:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "descriptive error message",
  "code": "error_code"
}
```
