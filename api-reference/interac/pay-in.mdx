## Create Purchase API Flow

The merchant initiates the purchase via the **Create Purchase API**. If successful, they receive **PayIn details** along with a **checkout URL** in the response JSON.

### Merchant Options

Once the merchant receives the response, they have two options:

1. **Retrieve PayIn details** from the response JSON to create a custom webpage within their IT estate, displaying the PayIn instructions to the user.
2. **Direct the user to the checkout URL** included in the response. On this page, the user will see the necessary details to complete the Interac payment:
   - **Deposit Email Address**
   - **Secret Question**
   - **Secret Answer**

### Handling Payment Outcomes

After the end-user completes the payment (success or failure), the merchant will receive an appropriate **webhook notification**.

- If the user was directed to the checkout URL, they will also be redirected to the appropriate **redirect URL** after payment completion.

### API Endpoints

#### **POST Create Purchase**

**Endpoint:**
```
POST https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/purchases/
```
To initiate a payment, the first call to make is to `/purchases` with the required data in the request body.

To generate a purchase, you must provide:
- **Brand ID** (in the request body)
- **API key** (in the header)

Both can be found in the Dashboard section of your merchant account.

#### **Mandatory Parameters**

| `failure_redirect`   | URL for failed transactions |

#### **GET Purchase Status**

**Endpoint:**
```
GET https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/purchases/{purchaseId}/
```
This API retrieves details of a purchase (PayIn), including its history.

**Required:** `purchaseId` in the API URL.

#### **Status Values**

| Status                 | Notes |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `paid`                | Transaction successful |
| `payment_in_process`  | Payment processing |
| `expired`             | Purchase expired |
| `error`               | Transaction failed |

If errors occur, details can be retrieved from `transaction_data.attempts.error`.
