# Integration Steps

To start integrating, you must have **Merchant access** to our admin portal and **sandbox credentials**, which are required to complete the integration.

## Setup & Check Merchant Details

The first step in getting your integration ready is to verify that all your merchant details are correct on our **Merchant Portal**. If you detect any discrepancies, please contact your client support executive.

## Start with Sandbox Mode

Begin your integration in **sandbox mode** (toggle available in the top right-hand corner of your **Merchant Portal**) and complete the following steps:

1. **Generate API Key** - This is necessary for sending transactions via the API.
2. **Create Brand ID** - Needed to send transactions. Use different **Brand IDs** for different shops or brands.
3. **Set Up Webhook (Recommended)** - Webhooks allow you to receive notifications from our server about transaction status changes. You can find more details on how webhooks work on the [Webhooks page](#).

## Go Live!

Once you've tested in **sandbox mode** and everything is functioning correctly, you can switch to live mode and start processing real transactions.
