# Session Management

Session management is crucial for maintaining user authentication and ensuring secure transactions within Paysecure. This guide covers how to handle sessions effectively.

## Establishing a Session

To establish a session, users must authenticate using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, a session token is issued.

### Authentication Example

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionToken": "abcdef1234567890",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

## Maintaining a Session

Use the session token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

```http
GET /api/user/profile
Authorization: Bearer abcdef1234567890
```

## Expiring and Refreshing Sessions

Sessions expire after a predefined duration. Users can refresh their session using a refresh token.

```http
POST /api/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refreshToken": "xyz123refresh"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionToken": "newabcdef1234567890",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

## Logging Out

To log out, revoke the session token.

```http
POST /api/auth/logout
Authorization: Bearer abcdef1234567890
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully logged out"
}
```

## Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS to encrypt session tokens.
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- Store session tokens securely, avoiding exposure in client-side code.
- Revoke inactive sessions periodically to enhance security.
