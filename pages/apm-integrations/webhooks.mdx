# ðŸ”Œ Webhooks

To receive information about various transaction statuses and events, you need to set up an endpoint that accepts payloads sent by Paysecure. Your endpoint will receive `POST` requests with `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Configuring the Webhook Endpoint

The webhook endpoint can be set up in **Partner Dashboard** â†’ **Webhooks** â†’ **New Webhook**. Ensure you save the endpoint by clicking **Create**.

Paysecure will post all payloads to the specified URL. If there are issues with delivery, the payload will not be resent.

**Note:**
- You can set up one URL for all events or individual URLs for each event.
- If using a single URL, the developer must extract the message from the payload information.

## Events

### PayIN Events

| Type                  | Executed When                        | What is Sent               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Payment in Process   | Paid but payment is in process    | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Expired              | Transaction Expired               | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Error                | Transaction Error                 | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Paid                 | Payment Successful                | Purchase Object (Payload)  |

### PayOUT Events

| Type                  | Executed When                        | What is Sent               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Payout in Process    | Paid but payment is in process    | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Expired              | Transaction Expired               | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Error                | Transaction Error                 | Purchase Object (Payload)  |
| Paid                 | Payment Successful                | Purchase Object (Payload)  |

## Webhook Structure

### `paysecure_sign`

Paysecure adds a signature in the `paysecure_sign` header for verifying the payload. If you have already created a **public key** in your **Merchant Dashboard**, you can verify this signature by decrypting it with your **public key**.

To verify the signature, compare it with the following value:

```
purchaseId + "|" + status + "|" + brandId
```

### Example Code in Java

```java
private static boolean verify(String message, String signature, PublicKey publicKey) throws Exception {
    Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
    verifier.initVerify(publicKey);
    verifier.update(message.getBytes());
    return verifier.verify(Base64.getDecoder().decode(signature.getBytes()));
}
```

Where:
- `message` = `purchaseId + "|" + status + "|" + brandId`
- `signature` = Value of `paysecure_sign` received in the webhook

You can obtain the **Public Key** from your **Merchant Dashboard**.

**Note:**
- If a `success_callback` or `failure_callback` webhook is provided in the **Purchase API**, it will take priority over the webhooks set in the **Merchant Dashboard**.
- The webhook payload will be a JSON object (either a **purchase** or **payout** object) containing the status. This object is the same as what you receive from the `getStatus` API call.

## API Endpoints

- `https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/purchases/{purchaseId}/`
- `https://api.paysecure.net/api/v1/getpayout/{payoutId}/`

## Authorization

Ensure that requests use a **Bearer Token** for authentication.
