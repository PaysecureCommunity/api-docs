# UPI Payments Overview

## UPI Overview
The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) technology unifies various banking functions, smooth fund routing, and merchant payments under one roof by enabling multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank).

## Paysecure's UPI Product Suite
Paysecure’s UPI product suite enables merchants to initiate:
- **PayIns**: Consumers can utilize UPI to transfer funds from their bank account, through their bank’s app or website.
- **Payouts**: Facilitate real-time disbursements directly to consumers' accounts by UPI ID, IMPS, RTGS, and NEFT.

## PayIn Flows
### How it Works
Paysecure’s UPI PayIn API allows platforms to collect funds from payers through an intent flow/payment link without entering the payer's VPA. It is suitable for app or mobile-based flows.

### Key Steps
1. **Initiate Transfer Request**: The merchant sends a request to the UPI PayIn API, including the customer’s email address or mobile number, the amount to be collected, and an optional message.
2. **UPI Payment Options**: The API generates multiple payment options (PayTM, GPay, PhonePe, or QR code scanning).
3. **User Pays Using Their App**: The user completes the transaction using their preferred payment app or by scanning the QR code.
4. **Confirm Transfer Completion**: Paysecure sends a webhook notification upon payment completion.
5. **Update Merchant’s Account**: The merchant updates the customer’s account balance accordingly.

## PayOut Flows
### How it Works
Paysecure’s API enables UPI payouts through IMPS, UPI, RTGS, and NEFT to both bank accounts and UPI IDs (VPAs).

### Key Steps
1. **Validate Bank Account**: The merchant verifies the customer’s bank account before initiating payouts.
2. **Ensure Sufficient Balance**: The merchant checks their balance using the "GetBalance" API.
3. **Initiate Payout Request**: The merchant provides the beneficiary’s bank details and transfer type.
4. **Complete Payout**: Paysecure sends a webhook notification upon successful payout completion.
5. **Update Merchant’s Account**: The merchant updates their records based on the payout status.
