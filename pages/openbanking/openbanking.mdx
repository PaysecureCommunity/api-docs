## Paysecure Payment Flow

Paysecure leverages its OpenBanking network across Europe and the UK to enable secure and fast payments, making it a top choice for customers in these regions. It allows customers to pay in EUR or GBP via the PaySecure Gateway, directly through their bank account.

### Paysecure Gateway
Paysecure Gateway is a web page that handles all user interactions during the payment initiation process, including:

- User credentials input
- Interactive confirmation
- Progress reporting
- Error reporting

After your application receives a URL for executing a payment using PaySecure, you can redirect your end-user to it. There, they will see a screen that lets them pick a provider to execute the payment. The user will be asked to input credentials and, if needed, any interactive credentials. After the process is complete, the user will be redirected back to your application URL.

## PayIn User Flow

2. **Merchant Redirects to PaySecure Gateway:** The merchant's website or application redirects the customer to the PaySecure Gateway.

### Step 2: Redirect to Bank Login

2. **Authorize Payment:** The customer authorizes the payment using their bank’s authentication method (e.g., OTP, password).

### Step 5: Payment Processing and Confirmation
