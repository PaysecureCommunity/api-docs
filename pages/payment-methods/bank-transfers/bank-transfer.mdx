## ⚙️ Integration Steps

To start integrating, you should already have your Merchant access to our admin portal and sandbox credentials, which you will need to complete the integration. 

### 1. Setup & Check Merchant Details
The first step in getting your integration ready is to check whether all the details about you as a merchant are correct on our Merchant portal. If you detect anomalies, please contact your client support executive.

Start with **sandbox mode** (see the top right-hand corner on your merchant portal to toggle between modes) and create **three items** on your dashboard:

- **API Key** - Necessary to send transactions via API.
- **Brand ID** - Needed to send transactions. Use different brand IDs for different shops or brands.
- **Webhook** - Recommended to get notifications from our server to your server to inform you of transaction status changes and notifications about transactions. You can check all the details of how our webhooks work on the Webhooks page.

### 2. Test the Integration in Sandbox Mode
After finishing your integration, make sure your code is working as intended and test the purchase flow in the staging environment.

#### Testing Credentials (Only in Sandbox Mode)
You have the opportunity to test all APIs by performing a test purchase. To facilitate testing payments, you may utilize the following card numbers:

- **Card number:** 4444 3333 2222 1111 or 5555 5555 5555 4444
- **Name:** Any cardholder name
- **Expiry Date:** Any expiry larger or equal to the current month/year
- **CVC:** 345

### 3. Create and Test Credentials in Live Mode
After finishing your integration in sandbox mode, create the **three items** mentioned in step one in live mode as well. Test the integration using small amounts to ensure everything is working.

### 4. Go Live!
Just let the team know when that will be so that we can work with you to get everything done.

## 🏦 PayIn Flows
### How it Works
Paysecure's A2A paying system utilizes powerful Virtual Accounts capabilities, enabling you to support a wide range of scenarios using the following methods.

### Key Steps
#### Flow
1. The merchant platform retrieves the account details (Account number, IBAN, and SWIFT code) for the merchant-assigned currency account intended for the PayIn.
2. These account details are then provided to the payer, who is instructed to make the payment to this account.
3. The payer accesses their banking app and inputs the provided account details along with the transaction amount.
4. Upon receiving the money from the payer, Paysecure promptly receives an Inward Credit Notification (ICN) webhook from its banking partner, confirming that the funds have been deposited into the corresponding virtual account.
5. The ICN contains all relevant transaction details. Paysecure forwards this notification to the merchant to inform them of the transaction.

## 💸 PayOut Flows
### How it Works
Paysecure offers the ability to make payments to customers', individuals', or businesses' bank accounts using various transfer methods via its dashboard or suite of APIs. The dashboard consolidates all available features accessible through APIs, allowing you to easily go live with minimal technical setup.

### Key Steps
#### Flow
1. The merchant platform initiates the creation of a payout by passing beneficiary details, along with payout details.

   **Beneficiary details include:**
   - Beneficiary ID (email or phone)
   - Beneficiary's address (mandatory but not validated; if available, send it, otherwise use a placeholder value)
   - Beneficiary's bank details
   - Beneficiary's name

2. Upon completion of the payout, reaching either a Success or Failure state, Paysecure notifies the merchant’s platform via webhook, providing the final status of the transaction and additional details.
