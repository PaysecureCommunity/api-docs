## Custom Payment Flow - Server-to-Server

PaySecure offers **Server-to-Server ("S2S")** integration that enables processing payments on the server level, eliminating direct interaction between the client's browser or application and the API.

This integration allows you to build a setup that restricts payers from directly accessing platform resources.

To enable payment acceptance in your application or website using **Server-to-Server (S2S) integration**, follow the following **3-step routine**.

---

### Step 1: Create a Purchase

Make a **POST** request to `/purchase/` API to create a Purchase in the system. Ensure that you meet all the required criteria, including:

- Defining `success_redirect` and `failure_redirect` fields for the Purchase.
- Setting them to **valid URLs**.

---

### Step 2: Send the Payment Method

Send the payment method details to the payment URL by making a **POST** request to:

```
/p/{purchaseId}/?s2s=true
```

#### Request Body:

```json
{
    "cardholder_name": "dk",
    "card_number": "4444333322221111",
    "expires": "10/23",
    "cvc": "345",
    "remember_card": "on",
    "remote_ip": "157.38.242.7",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36",
    "accept_header": "text/html",
    "language": "en-US",
    "java_enabled": false,
    "javascript_enabled": true,
    "color_depth": 24,
    "utc_offset": 0,
    "screen_width": 1920,
    "screen_height": 1080
}
```

Refer to `/p/{purchaseId}/?s2s=true` API documentation for more details.

### Step 3: Handle 3D Secure Transactions (If Configured)

Once the response is received, if the purchase is **successful** (indicated by a response status code of `202`), you will receive the following response:

```json
{
    "status": "pending",
    "callback_url": "http://18.214.100.20/api/v1/payment/64bfc2a4f63e36669499e5cc/",
    "method": "GET"
}
```

Otherwise, if there is an error (response status code could be `400, 404, 401, 415, 405`), you'll receive an error response:

```json
{
    "message": "descriptive error message",
    "code": "error_code"
}
```

#### Handling Response:
- If the response code is `202`, redirect the customer to the `callback_url` provided in the response.
- If the card **requires 3D Secure verification**, the user will be redirected to a **verification or challenge screen** by the card issuing bank.
- After successful user verification, the user will be redirected to the **success URL** provided in the `/purchase` API from **Step 1**.
- If the transaction **fails**, the user will be redirected to the **failure URL** provided in the `/purchase` API from **Step 1**.
