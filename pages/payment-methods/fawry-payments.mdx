It provides a fast, secure, and convenient alternative to traditional payment methods, accessible through numerous banks and financial institutions in Egypt.

## PayIn API
### API Flow
1. The merchant initiates the purchase via the create purchase API. If successful, they receive PayIn details (Unique Ref Code) along with a checkout URL in the response JSON.
2. The merchant then has two options:
   - Use the PayIn details in the JSON to create a webpage within the merchantâ€™s IT estate and show the PayIn instruction to the user.
   - Direct the end-user to our checkout URL, where the client sees bank details for payment.
3. After a successful or failed payment by the end user, an appropriate webhook is sent to the merchant. If option 2b was used, the user is redirected to the appropriate redirect URL.
