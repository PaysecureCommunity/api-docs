## Integration Steps

To start integrating, you should already have your Merchant access to our admin portal and sandbox credentials, which you will need to complete the integration.

### 1. Setup & Check Merchant Details
The first step in getting your integration ready is to check whether all the details about you as a merchant are correct on our Merchant portal. If you detect anomalies, please contact your client support executive.

Start with sandbox mode (see the top right-hand corner on your merchant portal to toggle between modes) and create the following items on your dashboard:

- **API Key** - Necessary to send transactions via API.
- **Brand ID** - Needed to send transactions. Use different brand IDs for different shops or brands.
- **Webhook** - Recommended to get notifications from our server to your server, informing you of transaction status changes and other notifications. You can check all the details of how our webhooks work on the Webhooks page.

### 2. Test the Integration in Sandbox Mode
After finishing your integration, make sure your code is working as intended and test the purchase flow in the staging environment.

#### Testing Credentials (only in Sandbox Mode)
You have the opportunity to test all APIs by performing a test purchase. To facilitate testing payments, you may utilize the following card numbers:

- **Card Number:** 4444 3333 2222 1111 or 5555 5555 5555 4444
- **Name:** Any cardholder name
- **Expiry Date:** Any expiry larger than or equal to the current month/year
- **CVC:** 345

### 3. Create and Test Credentials in Live Mode
After finishing your integration in sandbox mode, create the three items mentioned in step one in live mode as well, and test the integration using small amounts to ensure everything is working.

### 4. Go Live!
Just let the team know when you are ready to go live so that we can work with you to finalize everything.
