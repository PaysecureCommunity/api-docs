## Open Banking Integration

### Overview
Third-Party Net Banking refers to the integration with local bank transfer systems in specific countries, enabling users to make payments directly from their bank accounts through a secure and trusted interface. This is particularly useful for regions where direct bank transfers are a preferred payment method over cards or other alternative payment methods (APMs).

### How PaySecure Leverages Third-Party Net Banking
PaySecure facilitates transactions through third-party net banking providers, allowing businesses to access localized payment options without the complexity of managing individual bank integrations. Each third-party service is tailored to the specific financial infrastructure of the country or region, ensuring:

- **Compliance:** Adherence to local banking regulations and financial standards.
- **Security:** Encrypted transactions and authentication mechanisms for secure payments.
- **Ease of Use:** Streamlined checkout experience for end users with minimal friction.

### Key Benefits of Third-Party Net Banking
- **Localized Payment Options:** Supports region-specific payment methods, giving customers familiar and trusted ways to pay.
- **Secure Transactions:** Payments are processed directly through the customerâ€™s bank, enhancing trust and security.
- **Real-Time Verification:** Enables real-time confirmation of payments, reducing risks and improving cash flow.
- **Compliance:** Adheres to local and international regulatory standards like PSD2 for Europe, ensuring that payments are secure and compliant.

This setup allows PaySecure to offer a diverse range of bank transfer options to its global clientele, catering to the specific needs of different regions while maintaining a consistent and secure payment experience.

### Getting Started
To integrate third-party net banking with PaySecure:

1. **Sign Up** for a PaySecure merchant account.
2. **Configure Banking Providers** through the dashboard.
3. **Implement API Endpoints** to enable bank transfer payments.
4. **Test & Go Live** with sandbox and production environments.

### Setup & Check Merchant Details
The first step in getting your integration ready is to check whether all the details about you as a merchant are correct on our Merchant portal. If you detect anomalies, please get in touch with your client support executive.

Start with sandbox mode (you can toggle between modes by clicking the top right-hand corner of your merchant portal) and create the following 3 items on your dashboard:

- **API Key:** Necessary to send transactions via API.
- **Brand ID:** Needed to send transactions. Use different brand IDs for different shops or brands.
- **Webhook:** You should get notifications from our server to your server to inform you of transaction status changes and notifications about transactions. You can check all the details of how our webhooks work on the Webhooks page.

### API Integration
#### Step 1:
Create a purchase using `POST /purchase/` API to create a Purchase in the system. Make sure to meet all the required criteria, which include defining `success_redirect` and `failure_redirect` fields for the Purchase and setting them to valid URLs.

#### Step 2:
The customer is redirected to the `checkout_url` page, which is configured to point to their net banking system.

#### Step 3:
Once the payment is initiated from the net banking site, the user will be redirected to the redirect URL.
