## How It Works

The pay-in process harnesses mobile money capabilities to support effortless collections. Merchants can initiate payment requests via USSD, offering a secure, efficient, and flexible method to collect customer payments.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Refunds are not possible over Mobile Money. Merchants must initiate a PayOut request manually to process any refunds.

### Key Steps

#### Initiate Transfer Request:
- The merchant sends a transaction request to the Mobile Money PayIn API.
- This request includes the customerâ€™s mobile number, the collection amount, and an optional message.

#### Send Notification:
- The customer receives a USSD pop-up with payment instructions on their mobile device.

#### Customer Completes Transfer:
- The customer follows the USSD instructions, enters their security PIN if required, and authorizes the transfer of funds to the merchantâ€™s account.

#### Confirm Transfer Completion:
- Once the payment is successful, the merchant receives a confirmation via a webhook indicating a successful transaction.

#### Update Merchantâ€™s Account:
- The merchantâ€™s system updates the customerâ€™s account balance to reflect the received funds.
